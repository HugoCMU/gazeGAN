# GazeGAN

GazeGAN tracks the gaze location of a user using the image from the webcam of their laptop.
Rather than collecting a large dataset of user data, GazeGAN uses synthetic images from a Unity
simulator and makes them more "real" using a GAN.  

## Requirements

- Python 3.5
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) 0.14
- [Unity](blank) 2017.3
- [OpenCV](blank) 3.0
